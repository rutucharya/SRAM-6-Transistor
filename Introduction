6T static random-access memory is a type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit. The term static differentiates it from dynamic RAM which must be periodically refreshed. This report demonstrates the design of a 6 - Transistor Static RAM cell that stores 1bit of data and also explains its READ and WRITE operation, implementation of design, and explains the function of how it stores 1bit in a cell.
